# Introduction 
### CH 1

**I** still remember the first time I launched minecraft, back when it was in version 1.12 got into singleplayer opened the world in survival & began breaking all the blocks i saw around me, i still remember walking into lava thinking it was some orange liquid and burning away into ashes. I was in my 8th grade, and only knew minecraft was just this cool game where everything is blocks

<sub>Need to change the above and improve clarity and vocabulary --> Adithya</sub>
<sub>or change the entire thing... --> Adithya</sub>

I think I beat the ender dragon the first time when I was super bored in summer vacations, still remember dying atleast a hundred times before I somehow managed to get under the dragon and kill it, 

<sub>Idk if this is good lmao --> Adithya</sub>

Around the same time period, I began watching minecraft related videos on YouTube, there was lots and lots of content, because as we all know the minecraft community is huge! on one really calm day, I came across a video with the thumbnail that said "How to play minecraft with friends" and that is where it all started, multiplayer, servers, SMPs, communities, 

After that day, my entire focus revolved around owning a server and having fun with friends, so the next day at school, I gathered all the few people who played minecraft in my grade and invited them to play with me on my *Aternos server* (`just server?`)

Its been 5 years and now I own a public minecraft community and a server, I will be linking the server and its socials ahead, do join in, have fun!

I hope by the end of this book, I will be able to successfully impart some knowledge about owning minecraft servers and managing them.

<sub>Flow? good? --> Adithya</sub>

Before I go ahead and talk more about what all you will be able to understand and explain by the end of this book, let me go ahead and tell more about me and my experience in owning & managing minecraft servers,

Managing servers, mostly has been fun, because its a way to meet new people, some good, supportive people who know how to go about or those who give new tips and tricks, and some bad, in the form of script kiddies, hackers, spammers, etc... Its always a 2 sided spectrum of people who you find in our journey of managing a minecraft server.

<sub>Refining needed --> Adithya</sub>

Is it fun? most of the time yes, at times, no, but it depends on the situation considered, but if you haven't yet tried hosting a minecraft server, I suggest you try it by reading through this book as this book is written to help you host and launch a server easily and as soon as possible.

Now let's take a step into the waters and find out what exactly you will learn in this book, summarized.

This book has {NUMBER_OF_CHAPTER} Chapters and is planned to cover a wide range of topics starting from the basic pre-requisites, server softwares, free hosts, self hosting, plugins, datapacks, server management, administration & optional topics such as pterodactyl and best practices.

This book is focused on providing its readers a complete step by step guide to explain the process of minecraft server management using various methods and holistically providing information to manage even the community of the minecraft server.
